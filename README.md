# Population Synthesizer using Hidden Markov Models

Population synthesis is a vital component in various fields like urban planning, transportation modeling, and public health research, providing realistic demographic profiles for simulation and analysis. This project introduces the development of a population synthesizer leveraging Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a statistical technique used for generating synthetic data from limited survey data.

## Overview

Conventional approaches to population synthesis often rely on deterministic methods, which may overlook the intricate dynamics and heterogeneity within real-world populations. This project addresses these limitations by proposing a novel approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs allow for the generation of synthetic populations with probabilistic transitions between states, mimicking the complex behavior observed in real populations.

## Methodology

The project employs Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to iteratively model the transition between different states of demographic variables such as age, gender, and educational background. By incorporating constraints derived from available survey data, including transition probabilities and emission probabilities, the synthesizer produces synthetic populations that closely mirror the target population's characteristics.

## Key Features

- **Hidden Markov Models:** Utilizes HMMs, a powerful statistical technique, for generating synthetic populations with probabilistic transitions between states.
- **Probabilistic Transitions:** Models transitions between demographic states probabilistically, capturing the dynamic nature of real populations.
- **Incorporation of Constraints:** Incorporates constraints derived from survey data to ensure the synthesized populations closely match the target population's characteristics.
- **Flexibility:** Offers a flexible and versatile tool for generating synthetic populations tailored to specific modeling and analysis needs.

## Experimental Results

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed population synthesizer in generating synthetic populations that exhibit high fidelity to the characteristics of real populations. 

## Potential Applications

The development of a population synthesizer utilizing Hidden Markov Models represents a significant advancement in population modeling and synthesis. This tool can find applications across diverse domains, including:

- Urban Planning
- Transportation Modeling
- Public Health Research
